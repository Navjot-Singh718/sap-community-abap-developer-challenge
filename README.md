# 2025 ABAP Developer Challenge Base Data Model

The pre requisite to this challenge is to create the base model for Travel Data and be ready for extending them at each step to complete the challenge. Here we will be creating a SAP-like database table with an existing include structure with 1 field. You will also create a data generator class to fill data to this table. Next you will create a CDS view entity for this database table. The steps to create each of these objects are mentioned below. Follow the steps carefully and do a data preview after each step to make sure you have enough demo data to proceed. 

Note:- Please make sure to replace 'XXX' with a unique alphanumeric character of your choice for all the objects that you create.

So let us start...

1. Create a database table to store the Travel data and copy the following code.

   This Travel table contains Travel ID, Total Price and Currency Code.

<pre lang="ABAP">

@EndUserText.label : 'Travel data for ABAP Challenge'
@AbapCatalog.enhancement.category : #EXTENSIBLE_ANY
@AbapCatalog.tableCategory : #TRANSPARENT
@AbapCatalog.deliveryClass : #A
@AbapCatalog.dataMaintenance : #RESTRICTED
define table ztravel_885 {
 
  key client    : abap.clnt not null;
  key travel_id : /dmo/travel_id not null;
  @Semantics.amount.currencyCode : 'ztravel_885.currency_code'
  total_price   : /dmo/total_price;
  currency_code : /dmo/currency_code;
  include ztravel_struc_885;
 
}

</pre>

2.  Now create the structure included in the code above which will be an extension of the table.
    ZTRAVEL_885.
    
<pre lang="ABAP">
@EndUserText.label : 'Structure of Travel Data'
@AbapCatalog.enhancement.category : #EXTENSIBLE_ANY
@AbapCatalog.enhancement.fieldSuffix : 'ZAC'
@AbapCatalog.enhancement.quotaMaximumFields : 350
@AbapCatalog.enhancement.quotaMaximumBytes : 3500
define structure ztravel_struc_885 {
 
  description : /dmo/description;
 
}
</pre> 

Activate the structure first and then the table to complete the table creation.

3. Extend the database table ZTRAVEL from task 0 (pre-requisite) by adding a new field TravelType following SAP's extensibility naming conventions.
<pre lang="ABAP">
@EndUserText.label : 'Indirect Append Table for ZTRAVEL_885'
@AbapCatalog.enhacement.category : #NOT_EXTENSIBLE
   extend type ztravel_struc_885 with z885_s_ext_travel {
   zztraveltype_ZAC : abap.char(20);
   }
   </pre>

3.  Next we will create data generator class to fill data to this table by fetching data from 
    /DMO/TRAVEL table.
    

<pre lang="ABAP">

CLASS ztravel_fill_data_885 DEFINITION
  PUBLIC
  FINAL
  CREATE PUBLIC .
 
  PUBLIC SECTION.
    INTERFACES if_oo_adt_classrun.
  PROTECTED SECTION.
  PRIVATE SECTION.
ENDCLASS.
 
 
CLASS ztravel_fill_data_885 IMPLEMENTATION.
 
  METHOD if_oo_adt_classrun~main.
 
   INSERT ztravel_885 FROM ( SELECT FROM /dmo/travel FIELDS travel_id, 
                                                            total_price, 
                                                            currency_code, 
                                                            description,
                                                           CASE
                                                             WHEN total_price > 4500 THEN 'Business'
                                                             WHEN total_price > 3000 THEN 'Premium Economy'
                                                             ELSE 'Economy'
                                                             END
                          ).
 
  ENDMETHOD.
ENDCLASS.
</pre>

Activate and execute the class and do a data preview of the table to make sure you have enough demo data to proceed.

Note: For standard SAP-delivered tables, you will not be able to do a Data Preview from ADT.


4.  Create a CDS view entity based on the database table above.

<pre lang="ABAP">
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: [#PROJECTION_LIST]
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT_REQUIRED
@EndUserText.label: 'Travel View Entity'
@Metadata.ignorePropagatedAnnotations: true
@AbapCatalog.extensibility: {
  extensible: true,
  elementSuffix: 'ZAC',
  quota: {
    maximumFields: 500,
    maximumBytes: 5000
  },
  dataSources: [ '_Travel' ]
}
define view entity ZITRAVEL_885
  as select from ztravel_885 as _Travel
   assocaition [0..*] to /DMO/I_BOOKING_U as _Booking on $projection/TravelId = _Booking.TravelID
{
  key travel_id     as TravelId,
      description   as Description,
      @Semantics.amount.currencyCode: 'CurrencyCode'
      total_price   as TotalPrice,
      currency_code as CurrencyCode,
   case 
   when total_price > 1000
   then cast( total_price as abap.fltp ) * 0.10
   else cast( 0 as abap.fltp )
   end as discount,
   
   _Booking.FlightDate as FlightDate,
   Case
   when  _Booking.FlightDate >= $session.system_date
   then dats_days_between ( $session.system_date, _Booking.FlightDate )
   else 0
   end as days_until_flight
   
}
</pre>

<pre lang="ABAP">
   extend view entity zitravel_885 with
   {
   _Travel.zztraveltype_ZAC as zztraveltype_ZAC
}

   </pre>
Activate the view and do a data preview of the view entity and make sure you see data in all the columns available.

Now you are ready to start the challenge. Proceed with the next steps in the blogpost to unlock question for each step.
